# GitHub Actions Verification Rule

**CRITICAL**: Always verify GitHub Actions pass before completing any task that modifies code.

## Verification Process

When code changes are made:

1. **Immediate Check**: After pushing changes, immediately check workflow status
2. **Wait Strategy**: If still running, wait 10 seconds and recheck (repeat 2 more times max)  
3. **Failure Analysis**: If failed, get detailed logs using `failed_only=true`
4. **Fix and Retry**: Address root causes, commit fixes, and reverify
5. **Success Confirmation**: Only consider task complete when ALL jobs pass

## Implementation

- Use GitHub API tools to check workflow runs
- Monitor the latest run for the current commit SHA
- Get failed job logs to understand specific issues
- Address dependency conflicts, API changes, version compatibility
- Don't ignore warnings - they can become errors in future versions

## Status Outcomes

✅ **SUCCESS**: All jobs pass - task can be completed
❌ **FAILURE**: Any job fails - must fix before completion  
⏳ **RUNNING**: Wait and recheck (up to 3 attempts)

This ensures code quality and prevents introducing breaking changes.
